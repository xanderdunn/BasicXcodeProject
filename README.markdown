An iOS app written entirely in Swift for quickly checking how much of your time and money something is worth.

Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- `cd` into the directory and run `pod update` to set-up the cocoapods
- Follow the below directions to rename the project to your app's name

To rename the project:
- Rename the project folder
- With the .xcworkspace open, slowly click twice on the project name at the top of the file navigator and enter the new name
- Close the workspace and rename the .xcworkspace file
- Rename the remaining folders in the file navigator
- Rename the "BasicXcodeProject" folder in the root of the repository
- Drag and drop the files that now show up as missing into the project.  
- Replace all instances of "BasicXcodeProject" in the code.  This includes instances in the .plist, so do a code search for the string.
- Replace "BasicXcodeProject" in the Podfile
- Run `pod update`
